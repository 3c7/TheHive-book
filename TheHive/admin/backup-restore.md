# Backup and restore data
All persistent data are stored in ElasticSearch database. The backup and restore procedures are the ones that are
detailed in
[ElasticSearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/modules-snapshots.html).

_Note_: you may have to adapt you indices in the examples below. To find the right indice, use the following command :

```
curl 'localhost:9200/_cat/indices?v'
```

## 1. Create a snapshot repository
First you must define a location in local filesystem (where ElasticSearch instance runs) where the backup will be
written. This repository must be declared in ElasticSearch configuration (elasticsearch.yml) by adding:
```
repo.path: ["/absolute/path/to/backup/directory"]
```
Be careful if you run ElasticSearch in Docker, the directory must be mapped in host filesystem using `--volume`
parameter (cf. [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/tutorials/dockervolumes/)).

Create a ElasticSearch snapshot point with the following command :
```
$ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_snapshot/the_hive_backup' -d '{
    "type": "fs",
    "settings": {
        "location": "/absolute/path/to/backup/directory",
        "compress": true
    }
}'
```

## 2. Backup your data
Start the backup by executing the following command :
```
$ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_snapshot/the_hive_backup/snapshot_1' -d '{
  "indices": "the_hive_10"
}'
```
You can backup the last index of TheHive (you can list indices in you ElasticSearch cluster with
`curl -s http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices | cut -d ' '  -f3` ) or all indices with `_all` value.

## 3. Restore data
Restore will do the reverse actions : it reads backup in your snapshot directory and load indices in ElasticSearch
cluster. This operation is done with this command :
```
$ curl -XPOST 'http://localhost:9200/_snapshot/the_hive_backup/snapshot_1/_restore' -d '
{
  "indices": "the_hive_10"
}'
```
